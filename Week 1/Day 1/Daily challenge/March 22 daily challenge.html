	<h1>What is League of Legends?</h1>
	<p>League of legends is a <strong>Moba</strong> game. Moba stands for <strong>Multiplayer online battle arena</strong>, which is a subgenre of strategy video games. Each player controls a single character as part of a team competing against another team of players. The <em>ultimate objective </em> is to destroy the opposing team's main structure with the assistance of periodically-spawned computer-controlled units that march forward along set paths.</p>
    <h2>Why do I enjoy League of Legends</h2>
    <p>League of Legends contains 148 different characters which allows for a huge variety of playstyles, therefore every game feels unique. League of Legends is extremely huge and has made it to <a href="https://watch.lolesports.com/">eSports</a>.</p>
